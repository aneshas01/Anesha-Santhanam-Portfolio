# About Me
Name: Anesha Santhanam 
Pronouns: she/her 
Bio: I am currently a student in the Masters of Information Systems Management program at Carnegie Mellon University. I will be graduating in December 2024 and moving on to a full-time role at Google as a Technical Program Manager. I am originally from New Jersey and have a passion for the intersection of technology, business and design. I have a deep knowledge of technical skills such as full stack development, application development, coding languages (Python, JavaScript, C++, Java, HTML/CSS, SQL), database development, and data analytics. My background in business consists of creating my own small business which provides free STEM education to local communities, client management, financial management, invoicing, and statistics for management. My design background involves 2D and 3D animation using ToonBoom & Blender, Tinkercad design, cell animation, 3D printing, metalwork, Figma, UI/UX, wireframing, graphic design, and editing on Photoshop/Adobe After Effects.

# What I Hope To Learn
I would like to put my skillsets in design, data analytics and technology together in order to represent data collected more accurately and clearly through digital mediums. This class will really help me understand which designs appeal most to the human eye as well as how to convey seemingly complex data in a simple, communicative way to individuals who may have little to no background knowledge about the dataset. I would like to use and apply these skills in the real world in presentations, meetings, and graphics that I create in the future.
