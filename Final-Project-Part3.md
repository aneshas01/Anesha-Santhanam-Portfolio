## Identifying the Topic of Choice and Datasets

When thinking of creating the visualization, I wanted to develop a report that would not only make the audience interested in the topic, but also lead them to develop their own conclusions. Although there were many statistical datasets out there that I could use, I ultimately decided to go with a topic that was more personal to the viewer, and this was the topic of dating. I was interested in portraying to my viewers which method of dating was the most successful in finding a partner. Ultimately, I narrowed this down between the comparison of online vs. in-person dating, especially since technology has reached a peak and many of the people I have talked to still crave an in-person connection while simultaneously being on dating apps. This was an interesting area to explore, so I decided to pursue this comparison based on demographics such as gender, sexual orientation, and ethnicity. 

As for data, this was slightly more tricky because there were no comprehensive datasets that could be exported to a CSV and extracted in Tableau or another visualization software. However, there was abundant data from research organizations such as Pew Research which consisted of surveys and other research studies asking questions to a large group of individuals and garnering responses. I decided to use this statistical data to aid in my visualizations, and I created my own dataset/spreadsheet based on the survey responses and other data that I discovered in the research studies. 

Based on this data and the topic, I completed Part 1, and identified what I wanted to create as my project along with sketches outlining the user story and potential visualizations I would use in the project.
