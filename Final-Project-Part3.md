# Final Project Part 3

## Completed Data Story: Shorthand

[Dating For Success: The Best Way, Statistically, To Find The One](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/dating-for-success/index.html)

## Identifying the Topic of Choice and Datasets

When thinking of creating the visualization, I wanted to develop a report that would not only make the audience interested in the topic, but also lead them to develop their own conclusions. Although there were many statistical datasets out there that I could use, I ultimately decided to go with a topic that was more personal to the viewer, and this was the topic of dating. I was interested in portraying to my viewers which method of dating was the most successful in finding a partner. Ultimately, I narrowed this down between the comparison of online vs. in-person dating, especially since technology has reached a peak and many of the people I have talked to still crave an in-person connection while simultaneously being on dating apps. This was an interesting area to explore, so I decided to pursue this comparison based on demographics such as gender, sexual orientation, and ethnicity. 

As for data, this was slightly more tricky because there were no comprehensive datasets that could be exported to a CSV and extracted in Tableau or another visualization software. However, there was abundant data from research organizations such as Pew Research which consisted of surveys and other research studies asking questions to a large group of individuals and garnering responses. I decided to use this statistical data to aid in my visualizations, and I created my own dataset/spreadsheet based on the survey responses and other data that I discovered in the research studies. 

Based on this data and the topic, I completed Part 1, and identified what I wanted to create as my project along with sketches outlining the user story and potential visualizations I would use in the project. 

## Audience and Personas 

I identified the audience of my presentation in Part 2 as my classmates, since I would be presenting to them. My subset of classmates represents a larger set of adults living in the U.S. (either temporarily or permanently) ages 18-30. Although I initially defined the audience in Part 2 as just my classmates, I am amending this for Part 3 and identifying the audience as 18-29 year old adults living in the United States of America. Despite the topic being the most helpful for those who are single, I still think that it is interesting to include people who are not single as part of my audience because they may be interested in the statistics, compare how they met their partner to my data, and even offer this advice to their single friends. As someone in a relationship, I found this data very interesting so I believed that narrowing down the audience to just single adults was not the right move. This audience was represented in a variety of ways in Part 2, with the most prevalent being through a user study and personas. 

I first created the personas to represent two different audience members who may be interested in my story. I made two personas with completely different demographics relating to age, gender, sexual orientation, and background. This gave me a diverse perspective of the thoughts of potential individuals who may view my presentation. Using the personas, I was able to pinpoint that I wanted my presentation to be somehow personalized; doing this with many different audience members of different backgrounds was a challenge, so I came up with an idea to create a demographic table at the end of the presentation to show the audience that for their specific demographics, there is a specific recommended dating method. 

The user study was also a great way to get feedback on the initial ideas I had developed for the presentation. I selected four different participants who matched different demographics and backgrounds, showed them the current layout of my draft presentation from Part 1, and asked them follow up questions about their thoughts. Through this method, I found out that all participants agreed that they wanted more complexity of graphs and specific graphs related to different demographics. They also wanted a deeper dive into demographic statistics, which led me to implement the table in the end of the report so that all members of the audience could relate to the chart and recommendations.

Based on this feedback, I implemented the following changes (as mentioned in Part 2) to my final design:
1. I will edit the color scheme to be broader, including orange, pink, red, and purple. This spectrum allows for a wider color scheme to be used in pictures, fonts and even the graph colors.
2. I will include more graph types such as double bar graphs, line graphs, heatmaps, and other charts in order to show data more clearly.
3. I will expand my research so that I have thorough information on demographics in relation to ethnicity.
4. I will edit the country heat map to have a proper key.
5. I will change the color scheme of the graphs to match the color scheme of my presentation.
6. I will make my presentation more full, complex, and detailed.
7. I will make the final key takeaway the table of demographics and success rate per demographic, and put emphasis on it at the end of the presentation.
