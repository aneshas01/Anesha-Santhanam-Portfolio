# In-Class Exercises

## Challenge Exercise: Introduce Yourself with a Data Visualization
I wanted to represent my travels to the airport in a graph that was aligned visually with the topic I talked about. I wanted my visual to match so I drew a plane and had each window represent one time where I traveled to/from the airport, with windows bolded for departures and not bolded for arrivals. My modes of transportation were indicated by the color of the window, and there were three different colors for each mode: the 28X bus, Uber, or rental car. By looking at the graph, one may be able to tell that I was in a rush to the airport (taking an Uber vs 28X) or maybe even in a rush to get home. This also signifies the number of flights I took this semester, which shows that I have gone traveling a lot!

## Challenge Exercise: Data Visualizations Are Everywhere
Attached is a picture of the hospital across from my apartment. I have always thought that it looks like a bar chart due to the varying heights but same color of the different sections of the hospital.

## Challenge Exercise: Visualize Link and Node Data Using Kepler.gl
The first dataset shows donors and receipents for 412 food bank, I labeled donors in blue and recipients in red. I see that there is a lot of concentration near downtown pittsburgh and donors are more centralized while recipients are more spread out. The areas surrounding campus and outside of campus likely are in more need of donations.

The second batch of data shows arcs while help visualize from where to where the donations have been sent. I changed the colors to represent red for the recipients and blue for the donors. The arc changes as it moves further towards the donor points, which shows where the food is going. It is clear that a lot of the food is going out from the CMU/Oakland area to areas outside of the college/university area as shown by the arcs.
