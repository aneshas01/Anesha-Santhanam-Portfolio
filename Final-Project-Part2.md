# Final Project Part 2

## Shorthand Draft / Storyboard 

[Dating for Success - Visualization](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/dating-for-success/index.html)

## User Research Protocol

**Target Audience:** 

Since I am presenting to my classmates, which is made up of adults studying in a university in the United States, my target audience is U.S. adults. I would like the audience (my classmates) to relate directly to my data visualization and presentation, and see themselves represented in my data. The target audience demographics are a nearly even mix of genders, both international and domestic, students in college, some work experience, and adult living in the U.S.

**Approach:** 

I will identify representative individuals to interview by selecting my interviewees to match my target audience. Therefore, I will make sure that each interviewer fits the same demographics as my audience, which is student or employee, preferably a person of color, and an adult currently living in the U.S. There are other personal demographics of my audience which I do not know, so I will include a variety of these, such as dating experience and sexual orientation, which are integral to the study. I will therefore make sure I have participants of different sexual orientations and differnt dating experiences (both online and offline) and relationship statuses (dating, single, or other). 

**Interview Script:**

Introduction: Hi, thank you for participating in this user research for my project. I will provide you the link to a visualization. Please go through it on your own and note aloud things you notice, what you notice first, what you like, dislike, and other general thoughts. The data in the visualization is currently being worked on, so please do not view data in the visualization as completely accurate/final. Rather, please assume this data is correct for purposes of this study. 

(Particpant goes through the visualization and talks through it, noting thoughts aloud)

Follow-Up Questions:
1. Which graph stood out to you the most?
2. Were there any graphs which were confusing to you, and why?
3. What did you first notice when going through the visualization?
4. What are your thoughts about the color scheme?
5. What was your key takeaway from the visualization?

## Participant A: Research Findings

**Description:**

Demographics: Age 25, White, female, full-time employee, non-international, living in U.S., heterosexual. 

Experience: this participant has moderate experience with dating. She has dated both in-person and online, and is currently single. She is on numerous dating apps and also goes to events where she hopes to meet people socially. She has made time to explore dating more since she aims to get into a serious relationship. 

**Quotes on the Visualization:**

"I like the pink color scheme since for me it represents dating or love."

"I wish the sketches had a similar color scheme since the colors are kind of random."

"The theme is very interesting. The table at the end should be bigger becuase that is what I'm most interested in as a reader."

**Follow-Up Questions**

1. The online vs in-person graph. Very easy to read.
2. No but I would like different types of graphs for more variety.
3. I first noticed the titles which are very clear.
4. I loved the pink color scheme.
5. The takeaway for me was that I might find more love online than in-person! 

## Participant B: Research Findings

**Description:**

Demographics: Age 22, Hispanic, female, full-time student, international, living in U.S., queer. 

Experience: this participant has a low experience with dating, but high experience in having a successful relationship. She has dated only in-person, and is currently in a healthy relationship. She has many friends who are single and in the dating scene, and finds this topic generally interesting to read about. 

**Quotes on the Visualization:**

## Participant C: Research Findings

Demographics: Age 28, East Asian, male, full-time student, international, living in U.S., heterosexual. 

Experience: this participant has a low experience with dating. He has not explored his options much online or in-person due to the pursuing of multiple degrees. Now that he has time to start exploring options, he wants to know whether to go the online route or try to find someone in-person.

**Quotes on the Visualization:**

## Participant D: Research Findings

Demographics: Age 23, South Asian, male, full-time employee , non-international, living in U.S., queer. 

Experience: this participant has a high experience in dating online. He exclusively uses online apps to date, and feels as though he will not have as much success with in-person dating. He has had limited success online, so he is open to changing the method he uses. He is looking forward to seeing if statistically, he is making the right decisions with his dating methods.
