# Final Project Part 2

## User Research Protocol

**Target Audience:** 
Since I am presenting to my classmates, which is made up of adults studying in a university in the United States, my target audience is U.S. adults. I would like the audience (my classmates) to relate directly to my data visualization and presentation, and see themselves represented in my data. The target audience demographics are a nearly even mix of genders, both international and domestic, students in college, some work experience, and adult living in the U.S.

**Approach:** 
I will identify representative individuals to interview by selecting my interviewees to match my target audience. Therefore, I will make sure that each interviewer fits the same demographics as my audience, which is student or employee, preferably a person of color, and an adult currently living in the U.S. There are other personal demographics of my audience which I do not know, so I will include a variety of these, such as dating experience and sexual orientation, which are integral to the study. I will therefore make sure I have participants of different sexual orientations and differnt dating experiences (both online and offline) and relationship statuses (dating, single, or other).
